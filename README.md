# Niveus Unity Framework

It is a convenient and advanced framework for developers of games based on the Unity engine. The Niveus Framework is an add-on to Unity that makes the project logic more declarative than usual. It provides convenient tools for creating projects on Unity.

The framework is divided into two main categories: architectural functionality (focus on code structure, scalability, and project organization) and practical functionality (ready-made utilities for everyday tasks such as UI, animations, saves, etc.).

The project is decorated in a winter style. The word "Niveus" means "snowy" in Latin. So don't be surprised by the strange names. It's not that important, but let it be. The content of the framework has nothing to do with snow, it is universal for any project. <br>
It's a set of ready-made codes, scripts and tools that you (probably as a game developer) install in your Unity project, and they add new functions, simplifying your work.

**What is a "Module" in the Niveus Framework?** <br>
A module is like a "box" or a "block" in your game. In large projects without modules, the code becomes chaos - one script changes everything, and bugs multiply. Modules make the code clean: it's easy to add/remove parts, test separately.
